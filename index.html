    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      During my youth years, I lived and breathed technology. My passion for
      videogames extended to computers and what made them tick, so that I
      quickly became the "tech guy" among my circle of friends. Later on I
      decided to pursue my interest in music and languages by moving to the
      Netherlands, where I've been able to go through a wealth of enriching
      experiences. As I noticed that language and technology find a natural
      meeting point in coding, my fascination for development sparked. I'm
      incredibly enthusiastic to now have the chance to explore this new path
      and seize the opportunities that lie therein.
