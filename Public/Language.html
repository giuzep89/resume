    <h1>Language and me</h1>
    <p>
      Although this portfolio is chiefly meant to demonstrate my competence
      within the area of web development, I thought of taking a moment to
      mention this nonetheless. As an avid reader, I already had hints that
      language was gonna become one of my greatest passions, but I only
      discovered its true extent once I moved to the Netherlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming from the South of Italy, I had very limited exposure to other
      cultures, save through books, and then the internet. I didn't know then
      that being able to communicate with people from other countries and
      speaking a different languages was going to be like gazing into the
      infinite.

      What I found in the Netherlands surpassed even my wildest expectations.
      Being suddenly in contact with people from so many different realities
      made me want more and more. In time I realized I had a particular
      fascination with the Germanic languages. I'm still deeply interested in
      them, and right now I'm busy perfecting Dutch and English, while slowly
      making my way through Swedish. And I have no intention to stop anytime
      soon!
